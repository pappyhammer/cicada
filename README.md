# Deep calcium imaging transients detection
A deep-learning-based toolbox for inferring in vivo large scale neuronal activity from calcium imaging movie in the region CA1 of the developing hippocampus.

Code to run predictions or to train a new network + a GUI to label calcium imaging data or check the predictions accuracy. (Coming summer 2019. Currently in beta testing)
